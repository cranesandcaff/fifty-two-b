# 0 - App in 30 Minutes
## Creating a simple app for reading 52 Books this coming year.

### Summary
We'll focus almost completely and the "What" and "How" this tutorial, follow along and write the code in your own editor. Avoid copying and pasting, retyping it will make you think about what you're typing.

This chapter isn't meant to teach you much about programming or app development. It's a primer to give you a base and familiarity. You shouldn't need to know much about programming to follow along.

### Install Git
Git is a version control system. It allows programmers to track changes in their code and work work together in a simple manner. Go here(https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the instructions. Git is a really big Thing with a lot of complexity, but thankfully you can get by with knowing a few simple commands most of the time, and I'll be giving those to you.

### Install Meteor
Go here(https://www.meteor.com/install), follow the instructions.

### What We're Building
We're making a simple application for users to add books they are reading this year, track their page and write a review when they are done.

### Starting Line
You'll need to get a copy of the application base. It will contain a lot of the configuration to make this a bit easier. On your command line run the following.

    $ git clone https://github.com/cranesandcaff/fifty-two-b.git

Alternatively you could download the zip from this page(https://github.com/cranesandcaff/fifty-two-b).

Open the folder in your text editor of choice, I use Githubs Atom(https://atom.io/).

Inside you'll find an HTML page `fifty-two-b.html`, a license, a readme and a folder labelled tutorials.
