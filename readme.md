This is just a simple project to help me manage my own book reading plans, I start a lot of books I never finish and want to mitigate this in the new year.

## Built With:
- Meteor
- Angular
- MongoDB

## How To Set Up
You need Node, Meteor, and MongoDB. Git clone, then simply `meteor`. Boom bam, you got yourself a ~~stew~~ app.
